<song>Duke Ellington â€“ Three Little Words

"Three Little Words" as written by Carlos Centel Battey, Steven Andre Battey, Charles Stephens, Timothy Thomas Zimnoch, Candice Glover and Jason Nicholas Dmuchowski....

Three little words, oh what I'd give for that wonderful phrase, 
To hear those three little words that's all I'd live for the rest of my days.
And what I feel in my heart, they tell sincerely. 
No other words can tell it half so clearly.
Three little words, eight little letters which simply mean I love you.
