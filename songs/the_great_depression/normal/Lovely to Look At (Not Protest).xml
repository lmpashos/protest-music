Lovely To Look At
LOVELY TO LOOK AT
Eddy Duchin
- from the film "Roberta"
- words by Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh, music by Jerome Kern

Lovely to look at, delightful to know
And heaven to kiss
A combination like this
Is quite my most impossible scheme come true
Imagine finding a dream like you
You're lovely to look at
It's thrilling to hold you terribly tight
For we're together, the moon is new
And, oh, it's lovely to look at you tonight</song>
