<song>Just a Gigolo - Ted Lewis 
Twas in a Paris café at first I found him
He was a Frenchman, a hero of the war
But war was over and here's how peace had crowned him
Of which he'd medals to wear and nothing more

Now, every night in the same café he shows up
And as he strolls by, ladies hear him say
If you admire me, hire me
A gigolo who knew a better day

Just A Gigolo, everywhere I go
People know the part I'm playing
Paid for every dance, selling each romance
Every night some heart betraying

There will come a day, youth will pass away
Then what will they say about me
When the end comes I know they'll say
"Just A Gigolo," as life goes on without me
