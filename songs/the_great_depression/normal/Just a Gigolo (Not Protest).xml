<lyrics><verse>
    
    <line>Twas in a Paris café at first I found him</line>
<line>He was a Frenchman, a hero of the war</line>
<line>But war was over and here's how peace had crowned him</line>
<line>Of which he'd medals to wear and nothing more</line>
</verse>

<verse><line>Now, every night in the same café he shows up</line>
<line>And as he strolls by, ladies hear him say</line>
<line>If you admire me, hire me</line>
<line>A gigolo who knew a better day</line>
</verse>

<verse><line>Just A Gigolo, everywhere I go</line>
<line>People know the part I'm playing</line>
<line>Paid for every dance, selling each romance</line>
<line>Every night some heart betraying</line>
</verse>

<verse><line>There will come a day, youth will pass away</line>
<line>Then what will they say about me</line>
<line>When the end comes I know they'll say "Just A Gigolo,"</line> 
<line>as life goes on without me</line></verse>
