<song>
Well, I’m on my way to heaven,
We shall not be moved.
On my way to heaven,
We shall not be moved.
Just like a tree
that’s standing by the water side,
We shall not be moved.

CHORUS:
We shall not, we shall not be moved,
We shall not, we shall not be moved,
Just like a tree
that’s standing by the water side,
We shall not be moved.

We’re fighting for our freedom,
We shall not be moved.
We’re fighting for our children,
We shall not be moved.
Just like a tree
that’s standing by the water side,
We shall not be moved.

CHORUS
For the teachers who have taught us,
We shall not be moved.
For the folks who drive the school bus,
We shall not be moved.
Just like a tree
that’s standing by the water side,
We shall not be moved.

CHORUS
We’re brothers together,
We shall not be moved.
We’re sisters together,
We shall not be moved.
Just like a tree
that’s standing by the water side,
We shall not be moved.
