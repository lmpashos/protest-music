    1989 the number another summer (get down)<br />
    Sound of the funky drummer<br />
    Music hittin' your heart cause I know you got sould<br />
    (Brothers and sisters, hey)<br />
    Listen if you're missin' y'all<br />
    Swingin' while I'm singin'<br />
    Givin' whatcha gettin'<br />
    Knowin' what I know<br />
    While the Black bands sweatin'<br />
    And the rhythm rhymes rollin'<br />
    Got to give us what we want<br />
    Gotta give us what we need<br />
    Our freedom of speech is freedom or death<br />
    We got to fight the powers that be<br />
    Lemme hear you say<br />
    Fight the power<br />
    <br />
    <i>[Chorus]</i><br />
    <br />
    As the rhythm designed to bounce<br />
    What counts is that the rhymes<br />
    Designed to fill your mind<br />
    Now that you've realized the prides arrived<br />
    We got to pump the stuff to make us tough<br />
    from the heart<br />
    It's a start, a work of art<br />
    To revolutionize make a change nothin's strange<br />
    People, people we are the same<br />
    No we're not the same<br />
    Cause we don't know the game<br />
    What we need is awareness, we can't get careless<br />
    You say what is this?<br />
    My beloved lets get down to business<br />
    Mental self defensive fitness<br />
    (Yo) bum rush the show<br />
    You gotta go for what you know<br />
    Make everybody see, in order to fight the powers that be<br />
    Lemme hear you say...<br />
    Fight the Power<br />
    <br />
    <i>[Chorus]</i><br />
    <br />
    Elvis was a hero to most<br />
    But he never meant shit to me you see<br />
    Straight up racist that sucker was<br />
    Simple and plain<br />
    Mother fuck him and John Wayne<br />
    Cause I'm Black and I'm proud<br />
    I'm ready and hyped plus I'm amped<br />
    Most of my heroes don't appear on no stamps<br />
    Sample a look back you look and find<br />
    Nothing but rednecks for 400 years if you check<br />
    Don't worry be happy<br />
    Was a number one jam<br />
    Damn if I say it you can slap me right here<br />
    (Get it) lets get this party started right<br />
    Right on, c'mon<br />
    What we got to say<br />
    Power to the people no delay<br />
    To make everybody see<br />
    In order to fight the powers that be<br />
    <br />
    (Fight the Power)
