        <verse>
            <line>He said, "Son, have you seen the world?</line>
            <line>Well, what would you say if I said that you could?</line>
            <line>Just carry this gun; you'll even get paid."</line>
            <line>I said, "That sounds pretty good."</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>Black leather boots, spit shined so bright.</line>
            <line>They cut off my hair, but it looked alright.</line>
            <line>We marched, and we sang.</line>
            <line>We all became friends, as we learned how to fight.</line>
            <refrainSectionRef sectionRef="1"/>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>I kicked in the door, I yelled my commands.</line>
            <line>The children they cried, but I got my man.</line>
            <line>We took him away, a bag over his face,</line>
            <line>From his family and his friends.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>They took off his clothes; they pissed in his hands.</line>
            <line>I told them to stop, but then I joined in.</line>
            <line>We beat him with guns and batons</line>
            <line>Not just once, but again and again.</line>
            <refrainSectionRef sectionRef="1"/>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>She walked through bullets and haze</line>
            <line>I asked her to stop; I begged her to stay.</line>
            <line>But she pressed on,</line>
            <line>So I lifted my gun, and I fired away.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>And the shells jumped through the smoke</line>
            <line>And into the sand that the blood now had soaked.</line>
            <line>She collapsed with a flag in her hand,</line>
            <line>A flag white as snow.</line>

        <refrainLine lineID="6">Just medals and scars, so damn proud of me.</refrainLine>
