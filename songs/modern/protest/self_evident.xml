    <line>yes, </line>
    <line> us people are just poems </line>
    <line> we're 90% metaphor </line>
    <line> with a leanness of meaning </line>
    <line> approaching hyper-distillation </line>
    <line> and once upon a time </line>
    <line> we were moonshine </line>
    <line> rushing down the throat of a giraffe </line>
    <line> yes, rushing down the long hallway </line>
    <line> despite what the p.a. announcement says </line>
    <line> yes, rushing down the long stairs </line>
    <line> with the whiskey of eternity </line>
    <line> fermented and distilled </line>
    <line> to eighteen minutes </line>
    <line> burning down our throats </line>
    <line> down the hall </line>
    <line> down the stairs </line>
    <line> in a building so tall </line>
    <line> that it will always be there </line>
    <line> yes, it's part of a pair </line>
    <line> there on the bow of Noah's ark </line>
    <line> the most prestigious couple </line>
    <line> just kickin back parked </line>
    <line> against a perfectly blue sky </line>
    <line> on a morning beatific </line>
    <line> in its Indian summer breeze </line>
    <line> on the day that America </line>
    <line> fell to its knees </line>
    <line> after strutting around for a century </line>
    <line> without saying thank you </line>
    <line> or please </line>
    <line> and the shock was subsonic </line>
    <line> and the smoke was deafening </line>
    <line> between the setup and the punch line </line>
    <line> cuz we were all on time for work that day </line>
    <line> we all boarded that plane for it to fly </line>
    <line> and then while the fires were raging </line>
    <line> we all climbed up on the windowsill </line>
    <line> and then we all held hands </line>
    <line> and jumped into the sky </line>
    <line> </line>
    <line> and every borough looked up when it heard the first blast </line>
    <line> and then every dumb action movie was summarily surpassed </line>
    <line> and the exodus uptown by foot and motorcar </line>
    <line> looked more like war than anything I've seen so far </line>
    <line> so far </line>
    <line> so far </line>
    <line> so fierce and ingenious </line>
    <line> a poetic specter so far gone </line>
    <line> that every jackass newscaster was struck dumb and stumbling </line>
    <line> over 'oh my god' and 'this is unbelievable' and on and on </line>
    <line> and I'll tell you what, while we're at it </line>
    <line> you can keep the pentagon </line>
    <line> keep the propaganda </line>
    <line> keep each and every TV </line>
    <line> that's been trying to convince me </line>
    <line> to participate </line>
    <line> in some prep school punk's plan to perpetuate retribution </line>
    <line> perpetuate retribution </line>
    <line> even as the blue toxic smoke of our lesson in retribution </line>
    <line> is still hanging in the air </line>
    <line> and there's ash on our shoes </line>
    <line> and there's ash in our hair </line>
    <line> and there's a fine silt on every mantle </line>
    <line> from hell's kitchen to Brooklyn </line>
    <line> and the streets are full of stories </line>
    <line> sudden twists and near misses </line>
    <line> and soon every open bar is crammed to the rafters </line>
    <line> with tales of narrowly averted disasters </line>
    <line> and the whiskey is flowin </line>
    <line> like never before </line>
    <line> as all over the country </line>
    <line> folks just shake their heads </line>
    <line> and pour </line>
    <line> </line>
    <line> so here's a toast to all the folks who live in Palestine </line>
    <line> Afghanistan </line>
    <line> Iraq </line>
    <line> </line>
    <line> El Salvador </line>
    <line> </line>
    <line> here's a toast to the folks living on the pine ridge reservation </line>
    <line> under the stone cold gaze of mt. Rushmore </line>
    <line> </line>
    <line> here's a toast to all those nurses and doctors </line>
    <line> who daily provide women with a choice </line>
    <line> who stand down a threat the size of Oklahoma City </line>
    <line> just to listen to a young woman's voice </line>
    <line> </line>
    <line> here's a toast to all the folks on death row right now </line>
    <line> awaiting the executioner's guillotine </line>
    <line> who are shackled there with dread and can only escape into their heads </line>
    <line> to find peace in the form of a dream </line>
    <line> </line>
    <line> cuz take away our playstations </line>
    <line> and we are a third world nation </line>
    <line> under the thumb of some blue blood royal son </line>
    <line> who stole the oval office and that phony election </line>
    <line> I mean </line>
    <line> it don't take a weatherman </line>
    <line> to look around and see the weather </line>
    <line> Jeb said he'd deliver Florida, folks </line>
    <line> and boy did he ever </line>
    <line> </line>
    <line> and we hold these truths to be self evident: </line>
    <line> #1 George W. Bush is not president </line>
    <line> #2 America is not a true democracy </line>
    <line> #3 the media is not fooling me </line>
    <line> cuz I am a poem heeding hyper-distillation </line>
    <line> I've got no room for a lie so verbose </line>
    <line> I'm looking out over my whole human family </line>
    <line> and I'm raising my glass in a toast </line>
    <line> </line>
    <line> here's to our last drink of fossil fuels </line>
    <line> let us vow to get off of this sauce </line>
    <line> shoo away the swarms of commuter planes </line>
    <line> and find that train ticket we lost </line>
    <line> cuz once upon a time the line followed the river </line>
    <line> and peeked into all the backyards </line>
    <line> and the laundry was waving </line>
    <line> the graffiti was teasing us </line>
    <line> from brick walls and bridges </line>
    <line> we were rolling over ridges </line>
    <line> through valleys </line>
    <line> under stars </line>
    <line> I dream of touring like Duke Ellington </line>
    <line> in my own railroad car </line>
    <line> I dream of waiting on the tall blonde wooden benches </line>
    <line> in a grand station aglow with grace </line>
    <line> and then standing out on the platform </line>
    <line> and feeling the air on my face </line>
    <line> </line>
    <line> give back the night its distant whistle </line>
    <line> give the darkness back its soul </line>
    <line> give the big oil companies the finger finally </line>
    <line> and relearn how to rock-n-roll </line>
    <line> yes, the lessons are all around us and a change is waiting there </line>
    <line> so it's time to pick through the rubble, clean the streets </line>
    <line> and clear the air </line>
    <line> get our government to pull its big dick out of the sand </line>
    <line> of someone else's desert </line>
    <line> put it back in its pants </line>
    <line> and quit the hypocritical chants of </line>
    <line> freedom forever </line>
    <line> </line>
    <line> cuz when one lone phone rang </line>
    <line> in two thousand and one </line>
    <line> at ten after nine </line>
    <line> on nine one one </line>
    <line> which is the number we all called </line>
    <line> when that lone phone rang right off the wall </line>
    <line> right off our desk and down the long hall </line>
    <line> down the long stairs </line>
    <line> in a building so tall </line>
    <line> that the whole world turned </line>
    <line> just to watch it fall </line>
    <line> </line>
    <line> and while we're at it </line>
    <line> remember the first time around? </line>
    <line> the bomb? </line>
    <line> the Ryder truck? </line>
    <line> the parking garage? </line>
    <line> the princess that didn't even feel the pea? </line>
    <line> remember joking around in our apartment on avenue D? </line>
    <line> </line>
    <line> can you imagine how many paper coffee cups would have to change their design </line>
    <line> following a fantastical reversal of the New York skyline?! </line>
    <line> </line>
    <line> it was a joke, of course </line>
    <line> it was a joke </line>
    <line> at the time </line>
    <line> and that was just a few years ago </line>
    <line> so let the record show </line>
    <line> that the FBI was all over that case </line>
    <line> that the plot was obvious and in everybody's face </line>
    <line> and scoping that scene </line>
    <line> religiously </line>
    <line> the CIA </line>
    <line> or is it KGB? </line>
    <line> committing countless crimes against humanity </line>
    <line> with this kind of eventuality </line>
    <line> as its excuse </line>
    <line> for abuse after expensive abuse </line>
    <line> and it didn't have a clue </line>
    <line> look, another window to see through </line>
    <line> way up here </line>
    <line> on the 104th floor </line>
    <line> look </line>
    <line> another key </line>
    <line> another door </line>
    <line> 10% literal </line>
    <line> 90% metaphor </line>
    <line> 3000 some poems disguised as people </line>
    <line> on an almost too perfect day </line>
    <line> must be more than poems</line>
    <line> in some asshole's passion play </line>
    <line> so now it's your job </line>
    <line> and it's my job </line>
    <line> to make it that way </line>
    <line> to make sure they didn't die in vain </line>
    <line> sshhhhhh.... </line>
    <line> baby listen </line>
    <line> hear the train? </line>
</song>
