    <!-- start of lyrics -->
    God save the queen<br />
    The fascist regime<br />
    They made you a moron<br />
    Potential H-bomb<br />
    <br />
    God save the queen<br />
    She ain't no human being<br />
    There is no future<br />
    In England's dreaming<br />
    <br />
    Don't be told what you want<br />
    Don't be told what you need<br />
    There's no future, no future,<br />
    No future for you<br />
    <br />
    God save the queen<br />
    We mean it man<br />
    We love our queen<br />
    God saves<br />
    <br />
    God save the queen<br />
    'Cause tourists are money<br />
    And our figurehead<br />
    Is not what she seems<br />
    <br />
    Oh God save history<br />
    God save your mad parade<br />
    Oh Lord God have mercy<br />
    All crimes are paid<br />
    <br />
    When there's no future<br />
    How can there be sin<br />
    We're the flowers in the dustbin<br />
    We're the poison in your human machine<br />
    We're the future, your future<br />
    <br />
    God save the queen<br />
    We mean it man<br />
    We love our queen<br />
    God saves<br />
    <br />
    God save the queen<br />
    We mean it man<br />
    And there is no future<br />
    In England's dreaming<br />
    <br />
    No future, no future,<br />
    No future for you<br />
    No future, no future,<br />
    No future for me<br />
    <br />
    No future, no future,<br />
    No future for you<br />
    No future, no future<br />
    For you
