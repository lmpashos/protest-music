    <i>[1]</i><br />
    Come on come on<br />
    I see no changes. Wake up in the morning and I ask myself,<br />
    "Is life worth living? Should I blast myself?"<br />
    I'm tired of bein' poor and even worse I'm black.<br />
    My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch.<br />
    Cops give a damn about a negro? Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero.<br />
    Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares? One less hungry mouth on the welfare.<br />
    First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers.<br />
    Give 'em guns, step back, and watch 'em kill each other.<br />
    "It's time to fight back", that's what Huey said.<br />
    2 shots in the dark now Huey's dead.<br />
    I got love for my brother, but we can never go nowhere<br />
    unless we share with each other. We gotta start makin' changes.<br />
    Learn to see me as a brother 'stead of 2 distant strangers.<br />
    And that's how it's supposed to be.<br />
    How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?<br />
    I'd love to go back to when we played as kids<br />
    but things changed, and that's the way it is<br />
    <br />
    <i>[Bridge w/ changing ad libs]</i><br />
    Come on come on<br />
    That's just the way it is<br />
    Things'll never be the same<br />
    That's just the way it is<br />
    aww yeah<br />
    <i>[Repeat]</i><br />
    <br />
    I see no changes. All I see is racist faces.<br />
    Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races we under.<br />
    I wonder what it takes to make this one better place...<br />
    let's erase the wasted.<br />
    Take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right.<br />
    'Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight.<br />
    And only time we chill is when we kill each other.<br />
    It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other.<br />
    And although it seems heaven sent,<br />
    we ain't ready to see a black President, uhh.<br />
    It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact...<br />
    the penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks.<br />
    But some things will never change.<br />
    Try to show another way, but they stayin' in the dope game.<br />
    Now tell me what's a mother to do?<br />
    Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you.<br />
    You gotta operate the easy way.<br />
    "I made a G today" But you made it in a sleazy way.<br />
    Sellin' crack to the kids. "I gotta get paid,"<br />
    Well hey, well that's the way it is.<br />
    <br />
    <i>[Bridge]</i><br />
    <br />
    <i>[Talking:]</i><br />
    We gotta make a change...<br />
    It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes.<br />
    Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live<br />
    and let's change the way we treat each other.<br />
    You see the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do<br />
    what we gotta do, to survive.<br />
    <br />
    And still I see no changes. Can't a brother get a little peace?<br />
    There's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East.<br />
    Instead of war on poverty,<br />
    they got a war on drugs so the police can bother me.<br />
    And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do.<br />
    But now I'm back with the facts givin' 'em back to you.<br />
    Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up, crack you up and pimp smack you up.<br />
    You gotta learn to hold ya own.<br />
    They get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone.<br />
    But tell the cops they can't touch this.<br />
    I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this.<br />
    That's the sound of my tool. You say it ain't cool, but mama didn't raise no fool.<br />
    And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped and I never get to lay back.<br />
    'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback.<br />
    Some buck that I roughed up way back... comin' back after all these years.<br />
    Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat. That's the way it is. uhh<br />
    <br />
    <i>[Bridge 'til fade:]</i><br />
    Some things will never change
