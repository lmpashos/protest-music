            <line>Come on come on</line>
            <line>I see no changes. Wake up in the morning and I ask myself,</line>
            <line>"Is life worth living? Should I blast myself?"</line>
            <line>I'm tired of bein' poor and even worse I'm black.</line>
            <line>My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch.</line>
            <line>Cops give a damn about a negro? Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a
                hero.</line>
            <line>Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares? One less hungry mouth on the
                welfare.</line>
            <line>First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers.</line>
            <line>Give 'em guns, step back, and watch 'em kill each other.</line>
            <line>"It's time to fight back", that's what Huey said.</line>
            <line>2 shots in the dark now Huey's dead.</line>
            <line>I got love for my brother, but we can never go nowhere</line>
            <line>unless we share with each other. We gotta start makin' changes.</line>
            <line>Learn to see me as a brother 'stead of 2 distant strangers.</line>
            <line>And that's how it's supposed to be.</line>
            <line>How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?</line>
            <line>I'd love to go back to when we played as kids</line>
            <line>but things changed, and that's the way it is</line>

            <line>I see no changes. All I see is racist faces.</line>
            <line>Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races we under.</line>
            <line>I wonder what it takes to make this one better place...</line>
            <line>let's erase the wasted.</line>
            <line>Take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right.</line>
            <line>'Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight.</line>
            <line>And only time we chill is when we kill each other.</line>
            <line>It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other.</line>
            <line>And although it seems heaven sent,</line>
            <line>we ain't ready to see a black President, uhh.</line>
            <line>It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact...</line>
            <line>the penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks.</line>
            <line>But some things will never change.</line>
            <line>Try to show another way, but they stayin' in the dope game.</line>
            <line>Now tell me what's a mother to do?</line>
            <line>Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you.</line>
            <line>You gotta operate the easy way.</line>
            <line>"I made a G today" But you made it in a sleazy way.</line>
            <line>Sellin' crack to the kids. "I gotta get paid,"</line>
            <line>Well hey, well that's the way it is.</line>

        <verse>
            <line>We gotta make a change...</line>
            <line>It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes.</line>
            <line>Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live</line>
            <line>and let's change the way we treat each other.</line>
            <line>You see the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do</line>
            <line>what we gotta do, to survive.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>And still I see no changes. Can't a brother get a little peace?</line>
            <line>There's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East.</line>
            <line>Instead of war on poverty,</line>
            <line>they got a war on drugs so the police can bother me.</line>
            <line>And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do.</line>
            <line>But now I'm back with the facts givin' 'em back to you.</line>
            <line>Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up, crack you up and pimp smack you up.</line>
            <line>You gotta learn to hold ya own.</line>
            <line>They get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone.</line>
            <line>But tell the cops they can't touch this.</line>
            <line>I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this.</line>
            <line>That's the sound of my tool. You say it ain't cool, but mama didn't raise no
                fool.</line>
            <line>And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped and I never get to lay
                back.</line>
            <line>'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback.</line>
            <line>Some buck that I roughed up way back... comin' back after all these years.</line>
            <line>Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat. That's the way it is. uhh</line>
