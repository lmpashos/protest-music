    <!-- start of lyrics -->
    Well, you wonder why I always dress in black,<br />
    Why you never see bright colors on my back,<br />
    And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone.<br />
    Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on.<br />
    <br />
    I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down,<br />
    Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town,<br />
    I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime,<br />
    But is there because he's a victim of the times.<br />
    <br />
    I wear the black for those who never read,<br />
    Or listened to the words that Jesus said,<br />
    About the road to happiness through love and charity,<br />
    Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me.<br />
    <br />
    Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose,<br />
    In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes,<br />
    But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back,<br />
    Up front there ought 'a be a Man In Black.<br />
    <br />
    I wear it for the sick and lonely old,<br />
    For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold,<br />
    I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been,<br />
    Each week we lose a hundred fine young men.<br />
    <br />
    And, I wear it for the thousands who have died,<br />
    Believen' that the Lord was on their side,<br />
    I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died,<br />
    Believen' that we all were on their side.<br />
    <br />
    Well, there's things that never will be right I know,<br />
    And things need changin' everywhere you go,<br />
    But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right,<br />
    You'll never see me wear a suit of white.<br />
    <br />
    Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day,<br />
    And tell the world that everything's OK,<br />
    But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back,<br />
    'Till things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black.
