    The world is my expense<br />
    The cost of my desire<br />
    Jesus blessed me with its future<br />
    And I protect it with fire<br />
    So raise your fists<br />
    And march around<br />
    Just dont take what you need<br />
    Ill jail and bury those committed<br />
    And smother the rest in greed<br />
    Crawl with me into tomorrow<br />
    Or Ill drag you to your grave<br />
    Im deep inside your children<br />
    Theyll betray you in my name<br />
    <br />
    Hey, Hey<br />
    Sleep now in the fire<br />
    Hey, Hey<br />
    Sleep now in the fire<br />
    <br />
    The lie is my expense<br />
    The scope of my desire<br />
    The party blessed me with its future<br />
    And I protect it with fire<br />
    I am the Nina The Pinta The Santa Maria<br />
    The noose and the rapist<br />
    The fields overseer<br />
    The agents of orange<br />
    The priests of Hiroshima<br />
    The cost of my desire<br />
    Sleep now in the fire<br />
    <br />
    Hey, Hey<br />
    Sleep now in the fire<br />
    Hey, Hey<br />
    Sleep now in the fire<br />
    <br />
    For its the end of history<br />
    Its caged and frozen still<br />
    There is no other pill to take<br />
    So swallow the one<br />
    That made you ill<br />
    The Nina The Pinta The Santa Maria<br />
    The noose and the rapist<br />
    The fields overseer<br />
    The agents of orange<br />
    The priests of Hiroshima<br />
    The cost of my desire<br />
    Sleep now in the fire<br />
    <br />
    Yeaaaaaah<br />
    <br />
    Sleep now in the fire<br />
    Sleep now in the fire<br />
    Sleep now in the fire<br />
    Sleep now in the fire	</p>
