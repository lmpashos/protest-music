    <!-- start of lyrics -->
    I am Governor Jerry Brown<br />
    My aura smiles<br />
    And never frowns<br />
    Soon I will be president...<br />
    <br />
    Carter Power will soon go away<br />
    I will be Fuhrer one day<br />
    I will command all of you<br />
    Your kids will meditate in school<br />
    Your kids will meditate in school!<br />
    <br />
    <i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
    California Uber Alles<br />
    California Uber Alles<br />
    Uber Alles California<br />
    Uber Alles California<br />
    <br />
    Zen fascists will control you<br />
    100% natural<br />
    You will jog for the master race<br />
    And always wear the happy face<br />
    <br />
    Close your eyes, can't happen here<br />
    Big Bro' on white horse is near<br />
    The hippies won't come back you say<br />
    Mellow out or you will pay<br />
    Mellow out or you will pay!<br />
    <br />
    <i>[Chorus]</i><br />
    <br />
    Now it is 1984<br />
    Knock-knock at your front door<br />
    It's the suede/denim secret police<br />
    They have come for your uncool niece<br />
    <br />
    Come quietly to the camp<br />
    You'd look nice as a drawstring lamp<br />
    Don't you worry, it's only a shower<br />
    For your clothes here's a pretty flower.<br />
    <br />
    DIE on organic poison gas<br />
    Serpent's egg's already hatched<br />
    You will croak, you little clown<br />
    When you mess with President Brown<br />
    When you mess with President Brown<br />
    <br />
    <i>[Chorus]</i>
