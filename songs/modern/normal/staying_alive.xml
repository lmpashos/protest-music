    <!-- start of lyrics -->
    Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk,<br />
    I'm a woman's man: no time to talk.<br />
    Music loud and women warm, I've been kicked around<br />
    Since I was born.<br />
    And now it's all right. It's OK.<br />
    And you may look the other way.<br />
    We can try to understand<br />
    The New York Times' effect on man.<br />
    <br />
    Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother,<br />
    You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.<br />
    Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin',<br />
    And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.<br />
    Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.<br />
    Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive.<br />
    <br />
    Well now, I get low and I get high,<br />
    And if I can't get either, I really try.<br />
    Got the wings of heaven on my shoes.<br />
    I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose.<br />
    You know it's all right. It's OK.<br />
    I'll live to see another day.<br />
    We can try to understand<br />
    The New York Times' effect on man.<br />
    <br />
    Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother,<br />
    You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.<br />
    Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin',<br />
    And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.<br />
    Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.<br />
    Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive.<br />
    <br />
    Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me.<br />
    Somebody help me, yeah.<br />
    Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me, yeah.<br />
    Stayin' alive.<br />
    <br />
    Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk,<br />
    I'm a woman's man: no time to talk.<br />
    Music loud and women warm,<br />
    I've been kicked around since I was born.<br />
    And now it's all right. It's OK.<br />
    And you may look the other way.<br />
    We can try to understand<br />
    The New York Times' effect on man.<br />
    <br />
    Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother,<br />
    You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.<br />
    Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin',<br />
    And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.<br />
    Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.<br />
    Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive.<br />
    <br />
    Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me.<br />
    Somebody help me, yeah.<br />
    Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me, yeah.<br />
    I'm stayin' alive.<br />
    <br />
    Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me.<br />
    Somebody help me, yeah.<br />
    Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me, yeah.<br />
    I'm stayin' alive.<br />
    <br />
    Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me.<br />
    Somebody help me, yeah.<br />
    Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me, yeah.<br />
    I'm stayin' alive.<br />
    <br />
    Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me.<br />
    Somebody help me, yeah.<br />
    Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me, yeah.<br />
    I'm stayin' alive.
