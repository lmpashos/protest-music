    <i>[1st Verse]</i><br />
    She Was More Like A Beauty Queen From A Movie Scene<br />
    I Said Don't Mind, But What Do You Mean I Am The One<br />
    Who Will Dance On The Floor In The Round<br />
    She Said I Am The One Who Will Dance On The Floor In The Round<br />
    <br />
    <i>[2nd Verse]</i><br />
    She Told Me Her Name Was Billie Jean, As She Caused A Scene<br />
    Then Every Head Turned With Eyes That Dreamed Of Being The One<br />
    Who Will Dance On The Floor In The Round<br />
    <br />
    <i>[Bridge]</i><br />
    People Always Told Me Be Careful Of What You Do<br />
    And Don't Go Around Breaking Young Girls' Hearts<br />
    And Mother Always Told Me Be Careful Of Who You Love<br />
    And Be Careful Of What You Do 'Cause The Lie Becomes The Truth<br />
    <br />
    <i>[Chorus]</i><br />
    Billie Jean Is Not My Lover<br />
    She's Just A Girl Who Claims That I Am The One<br />
    But The Kid Is Not My Son<br />
    She Says I Am The One, But The Kid Is Not My Son<br />
    <br />
    <i>[3rd Verse]</i><br />
    For Forty Days And for Forty Nights<br />
    The Law was on her Side<br />
    But Who Can Stand When She's In Demand<br />
    Her Schemes And Plans<br />
    'Cause We Danced On The Floor In The Round<br />
    So Take My Strong Advice, Just Remember To Always Think Twice<br />
    Do think Twice<br />
    <br />
    <i>[4th Verse]</i><br />
    She Told My Baby We'd Danced 'Til Three<br />
    Then She Looked At Me<br />
    She Showed A Photo Of A Baby Crying<br />
    His Eyes Looked Like Mine<br />
    Go On Dance On The Floor In The Round, Baby<br />
    <br />
    <i>[Bridge]</i><br />
    People Always Told Me Be Careful Of What You Do<br />
    And Don't Go Around Breaking Young Girls' Hearts<br />
    She Came And Stood Right By Me<br />
    Then The Smell Of Sweet Perfume<br />
    This Happened Much Too Soon<br />
    She Called Me To Her Room<br />
    <br />
    <i>[Chorus]</i><br />
    Billie Jean Is Not My Lover<br />
    She's Just A Girl Who Claims That I Am The One<br />
    But The Kid Is Not My Son<br />
    Billie Jean Is Not My Lover<br />
    She's Just A Girl Who Claims That I Am The One<br />
    But The Kid Is Not My Son<br />
    She Says I Am The One, But The Kid Is Not My Son<br />
    <br />
    She Says I Am The One, But The Kid Is Not My Son<br />
    <br />
    Billie Jean Is Not My Lover<br />
    She's Just A Girl Who Claims That I Am The One<br />
    But The Kid Is Not My Son<br />
    She Says I Am The One, But The Kid Is Not My Son<br />
    She Says I Am The One, She Says He Is My Son<br />
    She Says I Am The One<br />
    Billie Jean Is Not My Lover<br />
    Billie Jean Is Not My Lover<br />
    Billie Jean Is Not My Lover<br />
    Billie Jean Is Not My Lover<br />
    Billie Jean Is Not My Lover<br />
    Billie Jean Is Not My Lover
