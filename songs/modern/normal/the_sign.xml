    Shock!<br />
    <br />
    I got a new life<br />
    You would hardly recognize me I'm so glad<br />
    How could a person like me care for you<br />
    Why do I bother<br />
    When you're not the one for me<br />
    Oooo, is enough, enough<br />
    <br />
    I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign<br />
    Life is demanding without understanding<br />
    I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign<br />
    No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong<br />
    But where do you belong<br />
    <br />
    Under the pale moon<br />
    For so many years I've wondered who you are<br />
    How can a person like you bring me joy<br />
    Under the pale moon<br />
    Where I see a lot of stars<br />
    Is enough, enough<br />
    <br />
    I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign<br />
    Life is demanding without understanding<br />
    I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign<br />
    No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong<br />
    But where do you belong<br />
    <br />
    Oh, oh, oh, oh.<br />
    <br />
    I saw the sign and it opened up my mind<br />
    And I am happy now living without you<br />
    I've left you, ooohhh<br />
    I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign<br />
    No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong<br />
    <br />
    I saw the sign - I saw the sign - I saw the sign<br />
    I saw the sign - I saw the sign<br />
    I saw the sign - I saw the sign - I saw the sign<br />
    And it opened up my eyes I saw the sign
