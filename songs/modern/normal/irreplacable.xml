    To the left<br />
    To the left<br />
    <br />
    To the left<br />
    To the left<br />
    <br />
    Mmmm to the left, to the left<br />
    Everything you own in the box to the left<br />
    In the closet, that's my stuff<br />
    Yes, if I bought it, baby, please don't touch (don't touch)<br />
    <br />
    And keep talking that mess, that's fine<br />
    Could you walk and talk at the same time?<br />
    And it's my name that's on that tag<br />
    So remove your bags, let me call you a cab<br />
    <br />
    Standing in the front yard, telling me<br />
    How I'm such a fool, talking 'bout<br />
    How I'll never ever find a man like you<br />
    You got me twisted<br />
    <br />
    You must not know 'bout me<br />
    You must not know 'bout me<br />
    I can have another you in a minute<br />
    Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute (baby)<br />
    <br />
    You must not know 'bout me<br />
    You must not know 'bout me<br />
    I can have another you by tomorrow<br />
    So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin'<br />
    You're irreplaceable?<br />
    <br />
    So go ahead and get gone<br />
    Call up that chick, and see if she's home<br />
    Oops I bet you thought, that I didn't know<br />
    What did you think<br />
    I was putting you out for?<br />
    Because you was untrue<br />
    Rolling her around in the car that I bought you<br />
    Baby, drop them keys<br />
    Hurry up, before your taxi leaves<br />
    <br />
    Standing in the front yard, telling me<br />
    How I'm such a fool, talking 'bout<br />
    How I'll never ever find a man like you<br />
    You got me twisted<br />
    <br />
    You must not know 'bout me<br />
    You must not know 'bout me<br />
    I can have another you in a minute<br />
    Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute (baby)<br />
    <br />
    You must not know 'bout me<br />
    You must not know 'bout me<br />
    I will have another you by tomorrow<br />
    So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin'<br />
    You're irreplaceable (irreplaceable)?<br />
    <br />
    So since I'm not your everything (irreplaceable)<br />
    How about I'll be nothing (nothing)? Nothing at all to you (nothing, nothing)<br />
    Baby I won't shed a tear for you (I won't shed a tear for you)<br />
    I won't lose a wink of sleep (a wink of sleep)<br />
    'Cause the truth of the matter is (truth is)<br />
    Replacing you is so easy<br />
    <br />
    To the left, to the left.<br />
    To the left, to the left.<br />
    Mmmmm<br />
    To the left, to the left.<br />
    Everything you own in the box to the left<br />
    <br />
    To the left, to the left.<br />
    Don't you ever for a second get to thinking<br />
    You're irreplaceable?<br />
    <br />
    You must not know 'bout me<br />
    You must not know 'bout me<br />
    I can have another you in a minute<br />
    Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute (baby)<br />
    <br />
    You must not know 'bout me<br />
    You must not know 'bout me<br />
    I can have another you by tomorrow<br />
    So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin'?<br />
    You must not know 'bout me (baby)<br />
    You must not know 'bout me<br />
    I can have another you in a minute<br />
    Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute<br />
    <br />
    You can pack all your bags we're finished (you must not know 'bout me)<br />
    'Cause you made your bed now lay in it (you must not know 'bout me)<br />
    I could have another you by tomorrow<br />
    Don't you ever for a second get to thinkin'<br />
    You're irreplaceable?
