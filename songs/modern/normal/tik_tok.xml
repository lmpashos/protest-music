    Wake up in the mornin' feelin' like P-Diddy (hey what's up girl)<br />
    Grab my glasses I'm out the door I'm gonna hit the city (let's go)<br />
    Before I leave brush ma teeth with a bottle of Jack<br />
    'Cause when I leave for the night I ain't comin' back<br />
    <br />
    I'm talking pedicure on our toes toes<br />
    Trying on all our clothes clothes<br />
    Boys blowin' up our phones phones<br />
    <br />
    Drop top and playin' our favorite CD's<br />
    Pullin' up to the parties<br />
    Tryna get a little bit tipsy<br />
    <br />
    <i>[CHORUS]</i><br />
    Don't stop, make it pop<br />
    DJ, blow my speakers up<br />
    Tonight, Imma fight<br />
    'Til we see the sunlight<br />
    TiK ToK, on the clock<br />
    But the party don't stop no<br />
    Whoa-oh oh oh<br />
    Whoa-oh oh oh<br />
    <br />
    Don't stop, make it pop<br />
    DJ, blow my speakers up<br />
    Tonight, Imma fight<br />
    'Til we see the sunlight<br />
    TiK ToK, on the clock<br />
    But the party don't stop no<br />
    Whoa-oh oh oh<br />
    Whoa-oh oh oh<br />
    <br />
    Ain't got a care in world, but got plenty of beer<br />
    Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here<br />
    Now, the dudes are lining up cause they hear we got swagger<br />
    But we kick em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger<br />
    <br />
    I'm talkin' bout - everybody getting crunk, crunk<br />
    Boys tryna touch my junk, junk<br />
    Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk<br />
    Now, now - we goin' 'til they kick us out, out<br />
    Or the police shut us down, down<br />
    Police shut us down, down<br />
    Po-po shut us - (down)-man<br />
    <br />
    <i>[CHORUS]</i><br />
    Don't stop, make it pop<br />
    DJ, blow my speakers up<br />
    Tonight, Imma fight<br />
    'Til we see the sunlight<br />
    TiK ToK, on the clock<br />
    But the party don't stop no<br />
    Whoa-oh oh oh<br />
    Whoa-oh oh oh<br />
    <br />
    Don't stop, make it pop<br />
    DJ, blow my speakers up<br />
    Tonight, Imma fight<br />
    'Til we see the sunlight<br />
    TiK ToK, on the clock<br />
    But the party don't stop no<br />
    Whoa-oh oh oh<br />
    Whoa-oh oh oh<br />
    <br />
    <i>[BRIDGE]</i><br />
    DJ, You build me up<br />
    You break me down<br />
    My heart, it pounds<br />
    Yeah, you got me<br />
    With my hands up<br />
    You got me now<br />
    You got that sound<br />
    Yeah, you got me<br />
    <br />
    You build me up<br />
    You break me down<br />
    My heart, it pounds<br />
    Yeah, you got me<br />
    With my hands up<br />
    Put your hands up<br />
    Put your hands up<br />
    <br />
    Now, the party don't start 'til I walk in<br />
    <br />
    <i>[CHORUS]</i><br />
