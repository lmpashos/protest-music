    It's love...<br />
    It's love...<br />
    Love... get busy<br />
    Everybody's talkin all this stuff about me (Now now)<br />
    Why don't they just let me live (Oh oh oh)<br />
    I don't need permission<br />
    Make my own decisions (Oh!)<br />
    That's my prerogative<br />
    <br />
    They say I'm crazy<br />
    I really don't care<br />
    That's my prerogative<br />
    They say I'm nasty<br />
    But I don't give a damn<br />
    Gettin girls is how I live<br />
    Some ask me questions<br />
    Why am I so real<br />
    But they don't understand me<br />
    I really don't know the deal<br />
    About a brother<br />
    Trying hard to make it right<br />
    Not long ago<br />
    Befo' I win this fight<br />
    SING!<br />
    <br />
    Everybody's talkin all this stuff about me<br />
    Why don't they just let me live (Tell me why)<br />
    I don't need permission<br />
    Make my own decisions (Oh!)<br />
    That's my prerogative<br />
    It's my prerogative <br />
    (It's my prerogative)<br />
    <br />
    It's the way that I wanna live (It's my prerogative)<br />
    I can do just what I feel (It's my prerogative)<br />
    No one can tell me what to do (It's my prerogative)<br />
    Cause what I'm doin<br />
    I'm doin for you now<br />
    <br />
    Don't get me wrong<br />
    I'm really not zooped<br />
    Ego trips is not my thing<br />
    All these strange relationships<br />
    Really gets me down<br />
    I see nothin wrong<br />
    With spreadin myself around<br />
    SING!<br />
    <br />
    Everybody's talkin all this stuff about me (yeah) <br />
    Why don't they just let me live (Tell me why) <br />
    I don't need permission (I don't need) <br />
    Make my own decisions (my own decisions) <br />
    That's my prerogative<br />
    It's my prerogative<br />
    (It's my prerogative)<br />
    <br />
    I can do what I wanna do (It's my prerogative)<br />
    Truly live my life (It's my prerogative)<br />
    I'm doin it just for you (It's my prerogative)<br />
    Tell me, tell me<br />
    <br />
    Why can't I live my life (Live my life)<br />
    Without all of the things that people say (Ohhh Ohhh)<br />
    <br />
    Yo tell it, kick it like this<br />
    Oh no nooo<br />
    <br />
    I can do what I wanna do<br />
    Me and you<br />
    Together, together, together, together, together<br />
    <br />
    Everybody's talkin all this stuff about me (everybody's talkin)<br />
    Why don't they just let me live (why)<br />
    (Why don't they just let me live girl)<br />
    I don't need permission (I don't need permission)<br />
    Make my own decisions<br />
    That's my prerogative<br />
    <br />
    Everybody's talkin all this stuff about me (Everybody's talkin)<br />
    Why don't they just let me live<br />
    (Why don't they just let me live)<br />
    I don't need permission (I don't need)<br />
    Make my own decisions (My own decisions)<br />
    That's my prerogative<br />
