    <i>[Usher:]</i> <br />
    Peace up! A Town Down! <br />
    <br />
    <i>[Lil' Jon:]</i> <br />
    Yeah, (Yeah!) OK!<br />
    <br />
    (Usher! Usher! Usher! Usher!)<br />
    <br />
    <i>[Lil' Jon:]</i> <br />
    Lil' Jon!<br />
    <br />
    <i>[Usher:]</i><br />
    Yeah, Yeah, Yeah! Yeah, Yeah! Yeaah!<br />
    Yeah, Yeah, Yeah! Yeah, Yeah! Yeaah!<br />
    <br />
    <i>[Usher (Verse 1):]</i><br />
    Up in the club with my homies, tryna get a lil' V-I, but keep it down on the low key, 'cause you know how it is.<br />
    I saw shorty she was checkin' up on me, from the game she was spittin' in my ear you would think that she knew me.<br />
    So we decided to chill <br />
    <br />
    Conversation got heavy, she had me feelin' like she's ready to blow!<br />
    (Watch Out! Oh! Watch Out!)<br />
    She's saying "Come get me! Come get me",<br />
    So I got up and followed her to the floor, she said "Baby, let's go",<br />
    That's when I told her I said <br />
    <br />
    <i>[Usher (Chorus):]</i><br />
    Yeah (yeah) Shorty got down low and said come and get me <br />
    Yeah (yeah) I got so caught up I forgot she told me <br />
    Yeah (yeah) Her and my girl used to be the best of homies<br />
    Yeah (yeah) Next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming: <br />
    <br />
    Yeah, Yeah, Yeah! Yeah, Yeah! Yeaah!<br />
    Yeah, Yeah, Yeah! Yeah, Yeah! Yeaah!<br />
    <br />
    <i>[Usher (Verse 2):]</i><br />
    So she's all up in my head now, got me thinking that it might good idea to take her with me,<br />
    'Cause she's ready to leave (ready to leave)<br />
    But I gotta keep it real now, 'cause on a one to ten she's a certified twenty, but that just ain't me. Hey.<br />
    <br />
    Because I don't know if I take that chance just where it's gonna lead,<br />
    But what I do know is the way she dance makes shorty alright with me.<br />
    The way she (get low!)<br />
    I'm like yeah, just work that out for me.<br />
    She asked for one more dance and I'm<br />
    Like yeah, how the hell am I supposed to leave?<br />
    And I said <br />
    <br />
    <i>[Chorus]</i><br />
    <br />
    <i>[Lil' Jon:]</i><br />
    Hey, Luda! <br />
    <br />
    <i>[Ludacris (Verse 3):]</i><br />
    Watch out!<br />
    My outfit's ridiculous, in the club lookin' so conspicuous.<br />
    And Rowl! These women all on the prowl, if you hold the head steady I'm a milk the cow.<br />
    Forget about the game, I'm a spit the truth, I won't stop till I get 'em in they birthday suits. <br />
    So gimmie the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes, then bend over to the front and touch your toes.<br />
    I left the Jag and I took the Rolls, if they aint cutting then I put em on foot patrol.<br />
    How you like me now, when my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand,<br />
    Lets drank you the one to please, Ludacris fill cups like double D's.<br />
    Me and Ursh once more and we leave 'em dead, we want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed to say <br />
    <br />
    <i>[Chorus]</i><br />
    <br />
    <i>[Ludacris (Bridge):]</i><br />
    Take that and rewind it back, Lil' Jon got the beat to make ya booty go (clap) <br />
    Take that and rewind it back, Ursher got the voice to make ya booty go (clap) <br />
    Take that and rewind it back, Ludacris got the flow to make ya booty go (clap) <br />
    Take that and rewind it back, Lil' Jon got the beat to make ya booty go (clap)
