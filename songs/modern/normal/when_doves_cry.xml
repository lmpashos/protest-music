    Dig if u will the picture<br />
    Of u and I engaged in a kiss<br />
    The sweat of your body covers me<br />
    Can u my darling<br />
    Can u picture this?<br />
    <br />
    Dream if u can a courtyard<br />
    An ocean of violets in bloom<br />
    Animals strike curious poses<br />
    They feel the heat<br />
    The heat between me and u<br />
    <br />
    How can u just leave me standing?<br />
    Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)<br />
    Maybe I'm just 2 demanding<br />
    Maybe I'm just like my father 2 bold<br />
    Maybe you're just like my mother<br />
    She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)<br />
    Why do we scream at each other<br />
    This is what it sounds like<br />
    When doves cry<br />
    <br />
    Touch if u will my stomach<br />
    Feel how it trembles inside<br />
    You've got the butterflies all tied up<br />
    Don't make me chase u<br />
    Even doves have pride<br />
    <br />
    How can u just leave me standing?<br />
    Alone in a world so cold? (World so cold)<br />
    Maybe I'm just 2 demanding<br />
    Maybe I'm just like my father 2 bold<br />
    Maybe you're just like my mother<br />
    She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)<br />
    Why do we scream at each other<br />
    This is what it sounds like<br />
    When doves cry<br />
    <br />
    How can u just leave me standing?<br />
    Alone in a world that's so cold? (A world that's so cold)<br />
    Maybe I'm just 2 demanding (Maybe, maybe I'm like my father)<br />
    Maybe I'm just like my father 2 bold (Ya know he's 2 bold)<br />
    Maybe you're just like my mother (Maybe you're just like my mother)<br />
    She's never satisfied (She's never, never satisfied)<br />
    Why do we scream at each other (Why do we scream, why)<br />
    This is what it sounds like<br />
    <br />
    When doves cry<br />
    When doves cry (Doves cry, doves cry)<br />
    When doves cry (Doves cry, doves cry)<br />
    <br />
    Don't Cry (Don't Cry)<br />
    <br />
    When doves cry<br />
    When doves cry<br />
    When doves cry<br />
    <br />
    When Doves cry (Doves cry, doves cry, doves cry<br />
    Don't cry<br />
    Darling don't cry<br />
    Don't cry<br />
    Don't cry<br />
    Don't don't cry
