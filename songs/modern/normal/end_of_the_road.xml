    <i>[Spoken:]</i><br />
    Girl, you know we belong together<br />
    I have no time for you to be playing with my heart like this<br />
    You'll be mine forever, baby, you just see<br />
    <br />
    <i>[Verse:]</i><br />
    We belong together<br />
    And you know that I'm right<br />
    Why do you play with my heart?<br />
    Why do you play with my mind?<br />
    <br />
    Said we'd be forever<br />
    Said it'd never die<br />
    How could you love me and leave me<br />
    And never say goodbye?<br />
    <br />
    When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight<br />
    Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry<br />
    Pain in my head oh I'd rather be dead<br />
    Spinnin' around and around<br />
    <br />
    <i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
    Although we've come to the end of the road<br />
    Still I can't let you go<br />
    It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you<br />
    Come to the end of the road<br />
    Still I can't let you go<br />
    It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you<br />
    <br />
    Girl, I know you really love me,<br />
    You just don't realize<br />
    You've never been there before<br />
    It's only your first time<br />
    <br />
    Maybe I'll forgive you, hmm<br />
    Maybe you'll try<br />
    We should be happy together<br />
    Forever, you and I<br />
    <br />
    Will you love me again like you loved me before<br />
    This time I want you to love me much more<br />
    This time instead just come to my bed<br />
    And, baby, just don't let me down<br />
    <br />
    <i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
    Although we've come to the end of the road<br />
    Still I can't let go<br />
    It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you<br />
    Come to the end of the road<br />
    Still I can't let go<br />
    It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you<br />
    <br />
    <i>[Spoken:]</i><br />
    Girl, I'm here for you<br />
    All those times at night when you just hurt me<br />
    And just run out with that other fella<br />
    Baby, I knew about it, I just didn't care<br />
    You just don't understand how much I love you do you?<br />
    I'm here for you<br />
    I'm not out to go out and cheat on you all night<br />
    Just like you did, baby, but that's all right<br />
    Hey, I love you anyway<br />
    And I'm still gonna be here for you 'till my dying day, baby<br />
    Right now, I'm just in so much pain, baby<br />
    'Cause you just won't come back to me<br />
    Will you? Just come back to me<br />
    <br />
    (Lonely)<br />
    Yes, baby, my heart is lonely<br />
    (Lonely)<br />
    My heart hurts, baby<br />
    (Lonely)<br />
    Yes I feel pain too<br />
    Baby, please<br />
    <br />
    This time instead just come to my bed<br />
    And, baby, just don't let me down<br />
    <br />
    <i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
    Although we've come to the end of the road<br />
    Still I can't let go<br />
    It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you<br />
    Come to the end of the road<br />
    Still I can't let go<br />
    It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you<br />
    <br />
    <i>[Chorus â€” a cappella:]</i><br />
    Although we've come to the end of the road<br />
    Still I can't let go<br />
    It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you<br />
    Come to the end of the road<br />
    Still I can't let go<br />
    It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
