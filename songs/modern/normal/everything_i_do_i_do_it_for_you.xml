    <!-- start of lyrics -->
    Look into my eyes – you will see<br />
    What you mean to me.<br />
    Search your heart, search your soul<br />
    And when you find me there you'll search no more.<br />
    <br />
    Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for.<br />
    You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for.<br />
    You know it's true:<br />
    Everything I do, I do it for you.<br />
    <br />
    Look into your heart – you will find<br />
    There's nothin' there to hide.<br />
    Take me as I am, take my life.<br />
    I would give it all, I would sacrifice.<br />
    <br />
    Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for<br />
    I can't help it, there's nothin' I want more<br />
    You know it's true:<br />
    Everything I do, I do it for you, oh, yeah.<br />
    <br />
    There's no love like your love<br />
    And no other could give more love.<br />
    There's nowhere unless you're there<br />
    All the time, all the way, yeah.<br />
    <br />
    Look into your heart, baby...<br />
    <br />
    Oh, you can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for.<br />
    I can't help it, there's nothin' I want more.<br />
    <br />
    Yeah, I would fight for you, I'd lie for you,<br />
    Walk the wire for you, yeah, I'd die for you.<br />
    <br />
    You know it's true:<br />
    Everything I do, oh, I do it for you.<br />
    <br />
    Everything I do, darling.<br />
    You will see it's true.<br />
    You will see it's true.<br />
    Yeah!<br />
    Search your heart and your soul<br />
    You can't tell it's not worth dying for<br />
    I'll be there<br />
    I'd walk the fire for you<br />
    I'd die for you<br />
    Oh, yeah.<br />
    I'm going all the time, all the way.
