    I know this pain<br />
    Why do lock yourself up in these chains?<br />
    No one can change your life except for you<br />
    Don't ever let anyone step all over you<br />
    Just open your heart and your mind<br />
    Is it really fair to feel this way inside?<br />
    <br />
    <i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
    Some day somebody's gonna make you want to<br />
    Turn around and say goodbye<br />
    Until then baby are you going to let them<br />
    Hold you down and make you cry<br />
    Don't you know?<br />
    Don't you know things can change<br />
    Things'll go your way<br />
    If you hold on for one more day<br />
    Can you hold on for one more day<br />
    Things'll go your way<br />
    Hold on for one more day<br />
    <br />
    You could sustain<br />
    Or are you comfortable with the pain?<br />
    You've got no one to blame for your unhappiness<br />
    You got yourself into your own mess<br />
    Lettin' your worries pass you by<br />
    Don't you think it's worth your time<br />
    To change your mind?<br />
    <br />
    <i>[Chorus]</i><br />
    <br />
    I know that there is pain<br />
    But you hold on for one more day and<br />
    Break free the chains<br />
    Yeah I know that there is pain<br />
    But you hold on for one more day and you<br />
    Break free, break from the chains<br />
    <br />
    Some day somebody's gonna make you want to<br />
    Turn around and say goodbye<br />
    Until then baby are you going to let them<br />
    Hold you down and make you cry<br />
    Don't you know?<br />
    Don't you know things can change<br />
    Things'll go your way<br />
    If you hold on for one more day yeah<br />
    If you hold on<br />
    <br />
    Don't you know things can change<br />
    Things'll go your way<br />
    If you hold on for one more day,<br />
    If you hold on<br />
    Can you hold on<br />
    Hold on baby<br />
    Won't you tell me now<br />
    Hold on for one more day 'Cause<br />
    It's gonna go your way<br />
    <br />
    Don't you know things can change<br />
    Things'll go your way<br />
    If you hold on for one more day<br />
    Can't you change it this time<br />
    <br />
    Make up your mind<br />
    Hold on<br />
    Hold on<br />
    Baby hold on
