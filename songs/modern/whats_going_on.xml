    Mother, mother<br />
    There's too many of you crying<br />
    Brother, brother, brother<br />
    There's far too many of you dying<br />
    You know we've got to find a way<br />
    To bring some lovin' here today - Ya<br />
    <br />
    Father, father<br />
    We don't need to escalate<br />
    You see, war is not the answer<br />
    For only love can conquer hate<br />
    You know we've got to find a way<br />
    To bring some lovin' here today<br />
    <br />
    Picket lines and picket signs<br />
    Don't punish me with brutality<br />
    Talk to me, so you can see<br />
    Oh, what's going on<br />
    What's going on<br />
    Ya, what's going on<br />
    Ah, what's going on<br />
    <br />
    In the mean time<br />
    Right on, baby<br />
    Right on<br />
    Right on<br />
    <br />
    Father, father, everybody thinks we're wrong<br />
    Oh, but who are they to judge us<br />
    Simply because our hair is long<br />
    Oh, you know we've got to find a way<br />
    To bring some understanding here today<br />
    Oh<br />
    <br />
    Picket lines and picket signs<br />
    Don't punish me with brutality<br />
    Talk to me<br />
    So you can see<br />
    What's going on<br />
    Ya, what's going on<br />
    Tell me what's going on<br />
    I'll tell you what's going on - Uh<br />
    Right on baby<br />
    Right on baby
