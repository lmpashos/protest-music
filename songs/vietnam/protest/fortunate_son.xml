    <lyrics>
        <stanza>
            <line>Some folks are born made to wave the flag</line>
            <line>Ooh, they're red, white and blue</line>
            <line>And when the band plays "Hail to the Chief"</line>
            <line>Oh, they point the cannon at you, Lord</line>
        </stanza>
        <stanza>
            <line>It ain't me, it ain't me</line>
            <line>I ain't no Senator's son</line>
            <line>It ain't me, it ain't me</line>
            <line>I ain't no fortunate one, no</line>
        </stanza>
        <stanza>
            <line>Some folks are born silver spoon in hand</line>
            <line>Lord, don't they help themselves, oh</line>
            <line>But when the tax men come to the door</line>
            <line>Lord, the house look a like a rummage sale, yes</line>
        </stanza>

        <stanza>
            <line>It ain't me, it ain't me</line>
            <line>I ain't no millionaire's son, no, no</line>
            <line>It ain't me, it ain't me</line>
            <line>I ain't no fortunate one, no</line>
        </stanza>
        <stanza>
            <line>Yeah, some folks inherit star spangled eyes</line>
            <line>Ooh, they send you down to war, Lord</line>
            <line>And when you ask them, "How much should we give?"</line>
            <line>Oh, they only answer, more, more, more, oh</line>
        </stanza>
        <stanza>
            <line>It ain't me, it ain't me</line>
            <line>I ain't no military son</line>
            <line>It ain't me, it ain't me</line>
            <line>I ain't no fortunate one</line>
        </stanza>

        <stanza>
            <line>It ain't me, it ain't me</line>
            <line>I ain't no fortunate one, no, no, no</line>
            <line>It ain't me, it ain't me</line>
            <line>I ain't no fortunate son, no, no</line>
