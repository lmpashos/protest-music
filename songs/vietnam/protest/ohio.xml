            <line>Tin soldiers and Nixon coming,</line>
            <line>We're finally on our own.</line>
            <line>This summer I hear the drumming,</line>
            <line>Four dead in Ohio.</line>

        <stanza>
            <line>Gotta get down to it</line>
            <line>Soldiers are cutting us down</line>
            <line>Should have been done long ago.</line>
            <line>What if you knew her</line>
            <line>And found her dead on the ground</line>
            <line>How can you run when you know?</line>
