        <stanza>
            <line>Ooh, I bet you're wondering' how I knew</line>
            <line>'Bout your plans to make me blue</line>
            <line>With some other guy you knew before</line>
            <line>Between the two of us guys you know I love you more</line>
            <line>It took me by surprise I must say</line>
            <line>When I found out yesterday</line>
            <line>Don'tcha know that I</line>
        </stanza>
        <stanza>
            <line>Heard it through the grapevine</line>
            <line>Not much longer would you be mine</line>
            <line>Oh I heard it through the grapevine</line>
            <line>Oh I'm just about to lose my mind</line>
            <line>Honey, honey yeah</line>
            <line>(Heard it through the grapevine)</line>
            <line>(Not much longer would you be my baby, ooh, ooh, ooh)</line>
        </stanza>
        <stanza>
            <line>I know a man ain't supposed to cry</line>
            <line>But these tears I can't hold inside</line>
            <line>Losin' you would end my life you see</line>
            <line>'Cause you mean that much to me</line>
            <line>You could have told me yourself</line>
            <line>That you love someone else</line>
            <line>Instead I</line>
        </stanza>
        <stanza>
            <line>Heard it through the grapevine</line>
            <line>Not much longer would you be mine</line>
            <line>Oh I heard it through the grapevine</line>
            <line>And I'm just about to lose my mind</line>
            <line>Honey, honey yeah</line>
            <line>(Heard it through the grapevine)</line>
            <line>(Not much longer would you be my baby, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)</line>
        </stanza>
        <stanza>
            <line>People say believe half of what you see, son</line>
            <line>And none of what you hear</line>
            <line>But I can't help bein' confused</line>
            <line>If it's true please tell me dear</line>
            <line>Do you plan to let me go</line>
            <line>For the other guy you loved before?</line>
            <line>Don'tcha know I</line>
        </stanza>
        <stanza>
            <line>Heard it through the grapevine</line>
            <line>Not much longer would you be mine</line>
            <line>Baby I heard it through the grapevine</line>
            <line>Ooh I'm just about to lose my mind</line>
            <line>Honey, honey yeah</line>
            <line>(Heard it through the grapevine)</line>
            <line>(Not much longer would you be my baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)</line>
        </stanza>
        <stanza>
            <line>Honey, honey, I know</line>
            <line>That you're lettin' me go</line>
            <line>Said, I heard it through the grapevine</line>
            <line>Heard it through the grapevine</line>
