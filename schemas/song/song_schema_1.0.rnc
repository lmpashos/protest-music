# Good work on the schema!  The organization and extensive commenting is appreciated by the user, and will be useful if/ when you go
# back and edit it.  Most of all, we appreciate te version updates listed at the top, even though GitHub can be used to keep track of
# these edits, it is undoubtedly a nice feature to have within the schema.  When looking at the actual code, it is evident that you made
# a loosely constrained choices, which is a good idea when considering your research methodology.  Because of this, one will have to be
# especially attentive when tagging by hand.  From our understanding, Katie will be double checking all of the tagged XML to check for consistent
# tagging decisions, which is good practice.  
#
# Also, keep in mind the potential of the need for milestone tagging.  It would not be surprising to see noun or verb phrases to span over lines, so
# definitely check out Chapter 20 of the TEI guidelines for a start.  Using a closed line break element (<lb />) at the end of each line has been a utilized
# method for projects in the past. Also, keep in mind the research question and desired conclusions you want to make when approaching your markup.  At its 
# stage now, it is quite expansive before attributes are included.  It would be useful to develop some sort of guide, and provide your general rationale on the website. 
# We are excited to see how you approach the tagging process in the upcoming weeks.
#
# Keep up the good work and it is now a good time to make good progress on the XML markup!
